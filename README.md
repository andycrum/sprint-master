# SprintMaster
SprintMaster is a simple script that gives you information about your sprints. I wrote it to make writing sprint review emails easier.

## Getting Started
To use SprintMaster, you'll need an instance of JIRA running on Atlassian Cloud. You'll only really get value out of this if you're using JIRA Agile's sprint feature.

### Steps
1. Clone this repository
2. Edit `config/configuration.rb.example`, add your own values, and remove the `.example` file extension
3. Run `bin/sprint_master`
